Book Author Metadata Proposal
=============================

A proposed set of standard fields for sharing book author information between systems. The initial commit is based on data FictFact has collected on book authors in our database.

What's the point of this?
-------------------------
We noticed that there is a metadata for books, there doesn't seem to be anything for book authors. Trying to gather everything up so author information can be shared between folks seemed useful.
